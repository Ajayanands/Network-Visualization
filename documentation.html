            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                The Network Visualization project aims to facilitate the analysis and understanding of complex network structures by providing an intuitive and user-friendly tool. By leveraging the power of Python, along with the Tkinter, NetworkX, and Matplotlib libraries, the application offers a comprehensive solution for creating, manipulating, and visualizing network graphs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Network graphs are widely used to model relationships and connections between various entities, such as social networks, computer networks, biological networks, and transportation networks. However, analyzing and interpreting these graphs can be challenging without appropriate visualization tools. The Network Visualization project addresses this challenge by providing a GUI that enables users to interactively create, explore, and analyze network graphs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project utilizes the Tkinter library, which is a standard Python interface for creating graphical user interfaces. Tkinter provides a set of GUI components, such as buttons, labels, entry fields, and message boxes, that are used to build the application's interface. This allows users to interact with the network graph and perform various actions effortlessly.
            </p>
            <p>
                To handle the underlying network data and perform graph-related operations, the project employs the NetworkX library. NetworkX is a powerful Python library for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks. It provides a wide range of functions and algorithms for network analysis, including finding the shortest path between nodes, computing network metrics, and performing graph operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Matplotlib library is used for network graph visualization. Matplotlib is a popular plotting library in Python that provides a comprehensive set of functions for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations. In the context of the Network Visualization project, Matplotlib is used to draw and display the network graph on the GUI canvas, allowing users to visually explore the graph's structure and relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
                The application provides several key features to enhance the user experience. Users can add nodes and edges to the network graph by providing relevant information, such as node names, types, and edge weights. They can then visualize the graph in real-time, observing the connections and layout of the nodes. The application also allows users to find the shortest path between two nodes, providing insights into the most efficient routes or connections within the network. Additionally, users can obtain detailed information about individual nodes, enabling them to examine specific characteristics or attributes associated with each node.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, the Network Visualization project offers a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for network graph creation, manipulation, and visualization. It empowers users to gain insights into complex network structures, analyze relationships and connections, and make informed decisions based on the graph's properties and characteristics.

        <section id="algorithm">
            <h2>Algorithm</h2>
            <p>
                The Network Visualization project utilizes the following algorithmic approaches:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <code>create_network_graph(nodes_data, edges_data)</code>:
                    This function takes a list of nodes and edges data as input.
                    Using the NetworkX library, it creates a network graph by adding nodes and edges based on the provided data.
                    The function returns the constructed graph, which represents the network.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>display_network_graph(G, pos=None)</code>:
                    This function is responsible for displaying the network graph on the graphical user interface (GUI).
                    It takes a graph object (G) as input, representing the network to be visualized.
                    An optional node position dictionary (pos) can also be provided. If pos is not provided, the spring layout algorithm is used to determine the positions of the nodes.
                    The function utilizes the Matplotlib library to draw the nodes, edges, labels, and other visual components of the graph on the GUI canvas.
                    The resulting visual representation of the network graph is displayed to the user.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code>display_shortest_path(G, source_node, target_node)</code>:
                    This function finds the shortest path between two nodes in the network graph.
                    It takes the graph object (G) as input, representing the network graph.
                    Additionally, the source node and target node are specified as input parameters.
                    The function utilizes the NetworkX library to compute the shortest path between the source and target nodes in the graph.
                    Once the shortest path is determined, the function displays the path to the user, typically using a message box or a similar interface component.
                    The displayed shortest path provides information about the nodes and edges that need to be traversed in order to go from the source node to the target node.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The Network Visualization project will employ the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm as the primary layout algorithm for arranging the nodes and edges of the network visualization. The Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm is a force-directed layout algorithm that simulates the physical forces between the network elements to achieve an aesthetically pleasing arrangement.
            </p>
            <p>
                The algorithm works by iteratively simulating attractive and repulsive forces between the nodes. The attractive force pulls connected nodes closer together, while the repulsive force pushes all nodes apart to avoid overlap. By balancing these forces, the algorithm gradually converges to a stable configuration where the network elements are evenly distributed and exhibit a visually appealing structure.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm is widely used for visualizing large-scale networks due to its scalability and ability to handle complex structures. It can effectively capture the underlying patterns and relationships within the network data and produce layouts that facilitate visual analysis and exploration.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm, the Network Visualization project may incorporate other layout algorithms based on user preferences and network characteristics. For instance, if the network has hierarchical properties, a hierarchical layout algorithm such as the Sugiyama algorithm may be employed to emphasize the hierarchical structure and improve readability.
            </p>
            <p>
                The algorithmic choices will be made with careful consideration of the network characteristics, scalability requirements, and user experience, ensuring that the resulting visualizations effectively convey the inherent information and enable users to extract meaningful insights from the network data.
